To use Nvidia optimus driver, you need to start the optimus service.
To do that, you can add
	
	optimus_enable="YES"

to /etc/rc.conf

Alternatively you can do

	service optimus onestart

The optimus service provides a few configurable options:

	optimus_manage_kld: allow optimus to manage kldload/unload of
											the Nvidia kernel modules (default="YES")
	optimus_modeset: 		load Nvidia modeset kernel driver
											(default="YES")
	optimus_screen:			Screen number for running the optimus X
											server (default="8")
	optimus_x_conf:			Config file to use for X. If this doesn't
											exist it will be generated automatically.
											You should probably check the PCI address
											specified in the generated config file as
											it is extracted from pciconf automatically.
											(default="/usr/local/etc/X11/optimus.x.conf")
  optimus_x_flags:		optimus X server flags
											(default="-sharevts -noreset")

If you don't want optimus manage your kldload/unloads, you must
load nvidia.ko and/or nvidia-modeset.ko yourself.
Refer to x11/nvidia-driver for more info about this.

After you have the service running, you can use the provided
optirun command to run your programs on the Nvidia GPU:

	optirun glxgears
